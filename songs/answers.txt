We calculate the AVG(energy), AVG(valence) and AVG(danceability);
if(AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) > AVG(danceability))
{
    music type/mood: get amped up, entertained, and moving
    aura: purple

}
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) < AVG(danceability))
{
    music type/mood: calm, analytical, and introspective
    aura: green
}
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(danceability) > AVG(valence))
{
    music type/mood: high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds
    aura: orange

}
else if(AVG(danceability) + AVG(valence) > AVG(energy))
{
    music type/mood: optimistic and filled with wonder
    aura: pink

}
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(danceability) < AVG(valence))
{
    music type/mood:  focused and motivated
    aura: yellow

}
else if(AVG(danceability) + AVG(valence) < AVG(energy))
{
    music type/mood: emotional
    aura: blue

}


//no, i believe determining a human,s aura is way more complicated than just the one based on my assumption of a simple calculation. we must consider more factors such as the number of streams of a particular song.
