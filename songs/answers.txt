We calculate the AVG(energy), AVG(valence) and AVG(danceability);
if(AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) > AVG(danceability))
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) > AVG(danceability))
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(danceability) > AVG(valence))
else if(AVG(danceability) + AVG(valence) > AVG(energy))
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) > AVG(danceability))
else if(AVG(energy) + AVG(valence) > AVG(danceability))
